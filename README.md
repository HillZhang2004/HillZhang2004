# Hi, I’m Hill Zhang 👋

I build **evaluation-first ML and data projects** end to end, from cleaning and modeling to diagnostics, reports, and demos.  
Junior at **Claremont McKenna College** (Data Science + Mathematics, minor in Financial Economics), graduating **May 2027**.  
Seeking **Data Science / ML / Analytics** internships where I can own a pipeline and communicate results clearly.

## Featured projects

### Empirical Bayes CATE synthesis (RCT + observational)
**What it shows:** uncertainty-aware estimation, diagnostics, reproducible reporting (no participant-level data in repo).  
Repo: https://github.com/HillZhang2004/whi-cate-combined-estimators

### Airbnb pricing in European cities (R) — live report
**What it shows:** real-world tabular cleaning, feature engineering, regression, lasso/ridge, and a reproducible report. 
Repo: https://github.com/HillZhang2004/airbnb-price-modeling

### Lyrics genre classifier (TF-IDF vs MiniLM)
**What it shows:** strong baselines, embedding comparisons, evaluation with macro-F1 and confusion matrices.  
Repo: https://github.com/HillZhang2004/lyrics-genre-classifier

### Tag-based music recommender (Spotify + Last.fm)
**What it shows:** practical supervised ML with a runnable training pipeline and a demo workflow.  
Repo: https://github.com/HillZhang2004/tag-based-music-recommender

### Startup search engine (CLI)
**What it shows:** data structures + graph exploration in a clean CLI tool.  
Repo: https://github.com/HillZhang2004/startup-search-engine-public
